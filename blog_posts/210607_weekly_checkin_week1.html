<p><strong>1. What did you do this week?</strong></p>
<p>During the Community-Bonding-Period I met with my mentors and started to learn more about the current
    RawBrowser-Implementation by working on related issues (<a href="https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pull/9412">#9412</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pull/9414">#9414</a>, <a
            href="https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pull/9419">#9419</a>, <a
            href="https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pull/9444">#9444</a>). I also started reading into the
    documentation of some of the possible backend-alternatives (PyQt, pyqtgraph) and created my <a
            href="https://github.com/marsipu/gsoc2021">gsoc-repository</a> where prototypes and progress will be hosted.
</p>
<p><strong>2. What is coming up next?</strong></p>
<p>This first week of coding will be all about expanding the existing (only)pyqt-based prototype to be comparable to the
    other possible backends (pyqtgraph, vtk). In the course of that I will also probably start to refactor the
    prototypes to make their comparision in a future benchmark-utility easier.</p>
<p><strong>3. Did you get stuck anywhere?</strong></p>
<p>Learning about how Qt handles custom plots took (and still takes) me longer than expected and some problems of <a
        href="https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pull/9419">#9419</a> posed a challenge, but with the help of the
    other contributors/mentors those could be overcome.</p>
